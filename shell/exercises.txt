1. echo $SHELL
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh

2. Create a new directory called missing under /tmp.
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % mkdir /tmp/missing

3. Look up the touch program. The man program is your friend.
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % man touch

4. Use touch to create a new file called semester in missing.
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % touch touch /tmp/missing/semester

5. Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % echo '#!/bin/sh' > /tmp/missing/semester
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % echo 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> /tmp/missing/semester

6. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (./semester) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn’t work by consulting the output of ls (hint: look at the permission bits of the file).
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % /tmp/missing/semester
zsh: permission denied: /tmp/missing/semester

lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % ls -l /tmp/missing/semester
-rw-r--r--  1 lyfey  wheel  134 Sep 21 14:56 /tmp/missing/semester

7. Run the command by explicitly starting the sh interpreter, and giving it the file semester as the first argument, i.e. sh semester. Why does this work, while ./semester didn’t?
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % sh /tmp/missing/semester

8. Look up the chmod program (e.g. use man chmod).
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % man chmod

9. Use chmod to make it possible to run the command ./semester rather than having to type sh semester. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using sh? See this page on the shebang line for more information.
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % chmod +x /tmp/missing/semester

lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % /tmp/missing/semester

10. Use | and > to write the “last modified” date output by semester into a file called last-modified.txt in your home directory.
lyfey@Lyfeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % /tmp/missing/semester | grep "last-modified" > ~/last-modified.txt
